## ðŸš€ Getting Started

PlinxyBot is designed to be easy to set up and run locally. Follow these steps to get started on your own Discord bot journey.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **A Discord Bot Token**: Youâ€™ll need a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal. If you donâ€™t have one, follow [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) to create a bot and get a token.

### Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the PlinxyBot repository from GitHub. This will give you access to all the necessary files and folders.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlinxyDev/PlinxyBot
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd PlinxyBot

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install discord.js
npm install luxon
npm install quick.db
npm install better-sqlite3
npm install dotenv
```

This will ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.

### Setting Up the Bot

Before you can run the bot, make sure to add your Discord bot token to the configuration file.

1. Locate the `.env` file.
2. Add your Discord bot token in the code:
3. replace `your_bot_token_here` with the actual token from the Discord Developer Portal.

### Running the Bot

Once the configuration is complete, you can start the bot by running:

```bash
node index.js
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the bot go online in your Discord server!

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure to check:

- The Node.js and npm versions (use `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify).
- The bot permissions in the Discord Developer Portal.

Now you're all set to start using and developing PlinxyBot!
